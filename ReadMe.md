- factory pattern(or factory method)
- abstract factory: like factory but with more encapsolation, so there is a lot of interface 
and for creating each subclass there is different factory 
- strategy: a class can have different behavior dynamically.
- observer: like mess publisher-subscriber
- state: good for implementing life cycle, to change behavior dynamically
